Plan:
   Day01: Python Basics, Syntax, Data Types, Decision making

   Day03: Tuples, Lists, Comprehensions, Encapsulations, Inheritance, Overriding
   Day04: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Exceptions, Sets, Dictionaries, pip Package Manager
   Day05: PyTest & Selenium Packages, Framework

List: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates, indexed by position.
     Use when you need to store a sequence of items and may need to modify them later.

Tuple: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicates, indexed by position. Use for fixed collections of items that should not change.

Set: Unordered, mutable, does not allow duplicates, not indexed. Use for collections of unique items and set operations like union/intersection.

Dictionary: Unordered (insertion order preserved in Python 3.7+), mutable, keys must be unique, stores key-value pairs,
            indexed by key. Use for mapping relationships between keys and values

      my_list = [1, 2, 3]
      my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
      my_set = {1, 2, 3}
      my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
